# 🛒 Retail Sales Forecasting using ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost & LSTM

This project,focuses on forecasting daily retail sales using a range of classical time series and machine learning models to support better demand planning and inventory management.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict future daily product-level sales using different forecasting techniques and compare their performance to identify the most effective approach.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data)  
- **Files used**:
  - `sales_train_evaluation.csv`
  - `calendar.csv`
  - `sell_prices.csv`

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

1️⃣ ARIMA — Traditional time series forecasting  
2️⃣ Prophet — Facebook’s robust forecasting model  
3️⃣ XGBoost — Gradient boosting with lag-based features  
4️⃣ LSTM — Deep learning model for sequence prediction

---

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. Data preprocessing and merging from M5 dataset  
2. Feature engineering (e.g., lag features for machine learning models)  
3. Train-test split based on time series integrity  
4. Model training and forecasting (30-day horizon)  
5. Performance evaluation using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score

## 📊 Evaluation Summary

| Model   | MAE     | MSE       | RMSE    | R² Score |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| ARIMA   | 0.82    | 1.13      | 1.06    | -0.03    |
| Prophet | 29.42   | 1081.73   | 32.89   | -1.55    |
| XGBoost | 3961.57 | 1.66e+07  | 4078.59 | -16.39   |
| **LSTM** | **385.06** | **2.52e+05** | **501.57** | **0.76** |

✅ *LSTM achieved the best performance with the highest R² score.*
